# softwareMonitor
  Software versions life cycle monitor developed as my end-of-degree project using AngularJS, NodeJS, PostgreSQL and HTML. There are different screens available for users. One of them shows the progress of a Jira project, allowing users to control times and tasks and their progression, and even a selection of tasks to be monitorized. The second one allows a total control over the test tasks. The third one shows a panel in which you can control the deployment of diferent software versions along with clients and places where they have been deployed. The last one is another panel which shows the progress of projects and tasks of one project selected by the user.

## Usage
